# Embodied Cognition-Driven Interpretable Trajectory Prediction of Autonomous System
## 1 The code was written using python 3.9. The following libraries are the minimal to run the code: import pytorch import networkx import numpy import tqdm 
## 2 To train a model for each data set with the best configuration as in the paper, run: ./train.sh
## 3 To use the pretrained models at checkpoint/ and evaluate the models performance run: python test.py
